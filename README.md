# Arduino-Fan_controller_QSC_amp
Simple program coded for Attiny85 to control the speed of the cooling fan inside a QSC audio amplifier.

## Overview
This project is an Arduino-based that I made to control the speed of the cooling fan inside a QSC audio amplifier. It uses a OneWire temperature sensor.

## Features
- Basic automation loops and logic  
- Commented and structured code for readability

## Skills Highlighted
- Programming in C/C++ for microcontrollers
- Basic electronics and automation principles

## Usage
1. Open `Fan_controller_QSC_amp.ino` in Arduino IDE  
2. Upload to the Arduino board
3. Connect the input and output as per requirements
4. Test the program

## Notes
- Written around 2016 before my formal IT studies; shows structured code and practical electronics knowledge
